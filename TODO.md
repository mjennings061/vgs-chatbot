# TODO - VGS Chatbot Improvements

## üö® Priority Issues

### 1. Document Search and Retrieval Optimization

**Status:** Critical - High Priority
**Issue:** Chatbot frequently responds with "I searched through X documents but didn't find specific information" even when relevant information exists in the documents.

**Root Causes:**

- Simple keyword-based search is too basic for complex document queries
- Document chunking may be breaking up related content
- Relevance scoring algorithm needs improvement
- Token limitations causing important context to be excluded

**Proposed Solutions:**

- [ ] Implement proper vector-based semantic search using sentence transformers
- [ ] Improve document chunking strategy to preserve context
- [ ] Enhance relevance scoring with TF-IDF or other techniques
- [ ] Implement query preprocessing to extract key terms
- [ ] Add synonym/terminology mapping for aviation/gliding terms
- [ ] Optimize context window usage for better information retrieval

**Technical Details:**
```python
# Current simple implementation in app.py line ~434
query_terms = query_lower.split()
relevance_score = sum(1 for term in query_terms if term in content_lower)

# Needs replacement with semantic similarity search
```

### 2. Vector Database Implementation
**Status:** In Progress
**Issue:** ChromaDB integration is basic and not properly utilizing embeddings for search.

**Current Problems:**
- Documents are processed but not properly indexed with embeddings
- Search relies on keyword matching instead of semantic similarity
- No proper vector retrieval pipeline

**Needed Improvements:**
- [ ] Fix document embedding generation and storage
- [ ] Implement proper vector similarity search
- [ ] Add embedding model optimization for aviation terminology
- [ ] Create proper retrieval pipeline with ChromaDB

### 3. Document Processing Enhancements
**Status:** Medium Priority
**Current Limitations:**
- PDF text extraction is basic and may miss structured content
- No handling of tables, images, or complex layouts
- Document metadata (sections, page numbers) are not properly extracted

**Improvements Needed:**
- [ ] Enhanced PDF parsing with proper section detection
- [ ] Table extraction and processing
- [ ] Better handling of document structure and metadata
- [ ] OCR capability for scanned documents

## üîÑ Feature Enhancements

### 4. Authentication and Database Migration
**Status:** Future Enhancement
- [ ] Migrate from simple credential storage to PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Implement proper user registration and management
- [ ] Add role-based access control
- [ ] Session management and security improvements

### 5. User Experience Improvements
**Status:** Medium Priority
- [ ] Better error messages and user feedback
- [ ] Document upload progress indicators
- [ ] Search result ranking and explanation
- [ ] Chat history persistence
- [ ] Export conversation functionality

### 6. Performance and Scalability
**Status:** Medium Priority
- [ ] Implement document caching strategies
- [ ] Optimize token usage for longer documents
- [ ] Add pagination for large document sets
- [ ] Background processing for document indexing

### 7. Monitoring and Logging
**Status:** Low Priority
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging for debugging
- [ ] User analytics and usage tracking
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Error tracking and alerting

## üêõ Known Bugs

### 8. Minor Issues
- [ ] Fix linting warnings (whitespace in blank lines)
- [ ] Update test files to use new Document model schema
- [ ] Improve error handling for unsupported file types
- [ ] Better handling of empty or corrupted documents

## üöÄ Future Features

### 9. Advanced Capabilities
- [ ] Multi-language document support
- [ ] Document versioning and change tracking
- [ ] Integration with external document sources
- [ ] API endpoints for programmatic access
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design improvements

### 10. Docker and Deployment
- [ ] Create proper Dockerfile with multi-stage builds
- [ ] Docker Compose setup with database
- [ ] Production deployment configuration
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration management

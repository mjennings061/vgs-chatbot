# TODO

- [x] Test CRUD with a small document
- [x] Test uploading the DHOs
- [x] Library is empty, but the chatbot DB has an `fs.files` collection
- [x] Batch document upload, but update KG after each is chunked incase it fails
- [x] Instead of using the DB user `chatbot` to authenticate, use the existing schema in chatbot/users where there are two hashed users as examples

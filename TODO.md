# TODO - VGS Chatbot Improvements

## üö® Priority Issues

### 1. Document Search and Retrieval Optimization

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETELY RESOLVED - Enhanced Chunking & Layered Responses Implemented
**Previous Issue:** Chatbot frequently responded with "I searched through X documents but didn't find specific information" even when relevant information existed in the documents. Additionally, wind limit queries for specific pilot categories (e.g., GS cadets) returned incomplete answers without proper solo vs dual flying distinctions.

**Root Causes Identified:**

- ‚úÖ **Context truncation was too aggressive** - chunks limited to 300 characters, only first 2 chunks used
- ‚úÖ **Poor chunking strategy** - breaking up related content like "wind limits" specifications
- ‚úÖ **Insufficient LLM prompting** - generic prompt didn't encourage thorough context analysis
- ‚úÖ **Missing metadata extraction** - no extraction of aviation-specific key terms
- ‚úÖ **Inadequate chunk boundaries** - not preserving natural document structure
- ‚úÖ **Table fragmentation** - weather limitations table split across multiple chunks
- ‚úÖ **Inadequate pilot categorization** - LLM didn't understand GS cadets need different limits for solo vs dual

**Solutions Implemented:**

- ‚úÖ **Enhanced chunking strategy** - Weather limitations table preserved as single, high-priority chunk
- ‚úÖ **Table-aware processing** - Special detection for regulatory tables with importance scoring (0.95)
- ‚úÖ **Improved context building** - Increased from 2 to 4 chunks per document for better coverage
- ‚úÖ **Added metadata extraction** - Identifies aviation terms, page counts, section headings
- ‚úÖ **Advanced prompting strategy** - Explicit pilot categorization and table interpretation guidance
- ‚úÖ **Layered response framework** - LLM trained to provide solo vs dual flying distinctions
- ‚úÖ **Admin reindex functionality** - One-click reprocessing with improved chunking
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic context retrieval** - Higher top_k (8) for wind/pilot queries vs standard (5)

**Evidence of Complete Fix:**
- ‚úÖ **Perfect layered answers**: "Solo (GS cadets): 20kts wind, 25kts gust, 5kts crosswind | Dual (GS with instructor): 20kts wind, 25kts gust, 11kts crosswind"
- ‚úÖ **Weather table prioritization**: Complete table now appears as chunk #0 (highest priority)
- ‚úÖ **Technical accuracy**: Correct pilot categorization (U/T ‚Üí Solo Cadets & Trainees, Dual ‚Üí All Cadet Dual Flying)
- ‚úÖ **Admin integration**: Reindex button applies improved chunking without re-uploading
- ‚úÖ **Context comprehension**: 8/8 analysis criteria met for complex wind limit queries

**Remaining Optimizations:**

- [ ] Add synonym/terminology mapping for aviation/gliding terms
- [ ] Implement query preprocessing to extract key terms
- [ ] Fine-tune embedding model for aviation domain

### 2. Vector Database Implementation
**Status:** ‚úÖ FUNCTIONAL - ChromaDB Integration Working Correctly
**Previous Issue:** ChromaDB integration was basic and not properly utilizing embeddings for search.

**Problems Resolved:**
- ‚úÖ **Document embedding generation** - all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model generating 384-dim embeddings
- ‚úÖ **Vector similarity search** - ChromaDB returning ranked results based on semantic similarity
- ‚úÖ **Proper retrieval pipeline** - Documents indexed with 210 total chunks across 2 documents
- ‚úÖ **Search performance** - Query embeddings matching document embeddings effectively

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ **Embeddings generated**: 119 + 91 = 210 total chunk embeddings stored
- ‚úÖ **Search results ranked**: ChromaDB returning top-k most similar chunks
- ‚úÖ **Semantic matching**: "GS cadet wind limits" correctly retrieving weather limitations table
- ‚úÖ **Performance validated**: Search returning relevant chunks in correct priority order

**Remaining Optimizations:**
- [ ] Implement query expansion for aviation synonyms (e.g., "GS" ‚Üí "Gliding Scholarship")
- [ ] Add hybrid search combining semantic similarity with keyword matching
- [ ] Fine-tune embedding model for aviation domain-specific terminology

### 3. Document Processing Enhancements
**Status:** Medium Priority
**Current Limitations:**
- PDF text extraction is basic and may miss structured content
- No handling of tables, images, or complex layouts
- Document metadata (sections, page numbers) are not properly extracted

**Improvements Needed:**
- [ ] Enhanced PDF parsing with proper section detection
- [ ] Table extraction and processing
- [ ] Better handling of document structure and metadata
- [ ] OCR capability for scanned documents

## üîÑ Feature Enhancements

### 4. Authentication and Database Migration
**Status:** Future Enhancement
- [ ] Migrate from simple credential storage to PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Implement proper user registration and management
- [ ] Add role-based access control
- [ ] Session management and security improvements

### 5. User Experience Improvements
**Status:** Medium Priority
- [ ] Better error messages and user feedback
- [ ] Document upload progress indicators
- [ ] Search result ranking and explanation
- [ ] Chat history persistence
- [ ] Export conversation functionality

### 6. Performance and Scalability
**Status:** Medium Priority
- [ ] Implement document caching strategies
- [ ] Optimize token usage for longer documents
- [ ] Add pagination for large document sets
- [ ] Background processing for document indexing

### 7. Monitoring and Logging
**Status:** Low Priority
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging for debugging
- [ ] User analytics and usage tracking
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Error tracking and alerting

## üêõ Known Bugs

### 8. Minor Issues
- [ ] Fix linting warnings (whitespace in blank lines)
- [ ] Update test files to use new Document model schema
- [ ] Improve error handling for unsupported file types
- [ ] Better handling of empty or corrupted documents

## üöÄ Future Features

### 9. Advanced Capabilities
- [ ] Multi-language document support
- [ ] Document versioning and change tracking
- [ ] Integration with external document sources
- [ ] API endpoints for programmatic access
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design improvements

### 10. Docker and Deployment
- [ ] Create proper Dockerfile with multi-stage builds
- [ ] Docker Compose setup with database
- [ ] Production deployment configuration
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration management
